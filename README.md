## Retro 1999 Landing Page

Static landing page with late-90s / Y2K vibes (CRT glow, marquee, faux counter), built with **just HTML + CSS + JS**.

### Run

- **Option A (simplest)**: open `index.html` in your browser.
- **Option B (local server)**:

```bash
python3 -m http.server 5173
```

Then visit `http://localhost:5173`.

### Notes

- The page is intentionally **low-interaction** (no buttons, no sound).
- The “visitor counter” is local-only and stored in `localStorage`.
